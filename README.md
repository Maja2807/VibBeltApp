# Smart-FSLib-Android
FSLib-Android is an Android library to control the feelSpace naviBelt from your application. The feelSpace naviBelt is a device that provides tactile feedback using vibration motors located in a belt. The naviBelt can be controlled by an application via Bluetooth Low-Energy. The FSLib can be used in various domains, for instance in navigation applications, VR, simulation, research experiments that require tactile feedback, outdoor and video-games, applications that require tactile feedback to improve focus or attention.

## Coding convention

### Naming convention

We use the java-style 'convention' for names, see e.g. https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html. No `m`, `p`, `s`, `mm` prefix to indicate the scope of variables.

### Event notification (implementation of the observer pattern)

For public interfaces of the library see https://www.codeaffine.com/2015/03/11/getting-java-event-notification-right/.

### @NonNull and @Nullable annotations

These annotations can be used by methods that are not accessible outside of the library. However, the @NonNull and @Nullable annotations must not be used in public interfaces of the library. The parameters of public interface methods must always be checked for null value. Please also note that the annotations are not automatically added to the javadoc.
